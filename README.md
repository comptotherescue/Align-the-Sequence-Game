# Align-the-Sequence-Game

Sequence Alignment is an arrangement of DNA, RNA or protein sequences to identify similar or nearly similar sequences. This not only helps in identifying the similar functionality of the sequences but also helps in understanding the structure and evolutionary relationships. Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman[4] are two popular algorithms used for dovetail sequence alignment. We are limiting our project to Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. It uses dynamic programming to find the maximum score a sequence could have. Using this sequence as a best case we allow users to try and match the score by dynamically aligning the sequence on the UI.
